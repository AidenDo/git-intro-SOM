# About

This repository hosts information related to an introduction to version control and GitHub that will take place on July 7 from 9 am till 12 pm EDT.

# Technical requirements

Participants should bring along a laptop or other device on which they can store, install and compute and that has a modern web browser. If you have made it through the R and Python classes on the days before, you are probably good to go.

# Practice

The repo will also serve as a testing ground during the event, by way of the [exercises](exercises.md) and [issues](https://github.com/UVA-DSI/git-intro/issues).

# Reading

A list of things to read in preparation for the event can be found in [readings.md](readings.md).
